Today is the North London Derby. A clash as _team_ travels a hop and a skip away to take on _team_.
_manager_ is under a lot of pressure after starting the season with 3 loses and only scoring 1 goal.
It looks like the lineups are out. Here is Arsenal's starting 11:

                     _keeper_
  _defender_     _defender_      _defender_      _defender_
              _midfielder_             _midfielder_
     _winger_      _CAM_      _winger_
                    _striker_

Surprising selection today by _12_. _5_ was not expected to play today after just coming off of an injury.
_1_ takes the place of _winger_ who has been playing well since _2_'s abscence. Perhaps _5_ plans to bring
_striker_ and _4_ on as supersubs later in the game. Other subs include _defender_, _defender_, _midfielder_,
and _CAM_.
